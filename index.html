    <p>here's a brief history on myself</p>
    <p>as a kid, i was always hustling.  i wrote an ebook at the age of 7 titled “how to make money as a 7 year old”</p>
    <p>to give a few more examples…</p>
    <ul>
        <li>mowing lawns, raking leaves</li>
        <li>selling candy in school</li>
        <li>botting runescape and selling coins online</li>
        <li>ethereum mining machine</li>
        <li>fake lebron jerseys on ebay</li>
        <li>scaling niche instagram accounts -> promos</li>
        <li>writing essays for classmates</li>
    </ul>
    <p>+ many other ventures.</p>
    <p>in college, i worked on a [relatively] failed college marketplace startup.  i graduated in may 2023 with no job, no income.  </p>
    <p>i moved back to my childhood home that soon went up for sale due to familial financial struggles.</p>
    <p>i couldn’t work at home (long story), so i worked at a starbucks 1.5 miles away.  when my mom couldn’t drive me, i would walk.  i spent many days in that starbucks from dawn to dusk.  </p>
    <p>my brother gave me loans to pay for basic living expenses and my mom was always there for me emotionally.</p>
    <p>when we launched rizzgpt in july, it worked immediately.  suddenly, i was running a 200k mrr startup out of a starbucks.</p>
    <p>in october, i split from rizzgpt (kept equity).  i spent a month living in a friends’ house and then on my brother’s couch.</p>
    <p>when we finally began taking profits from rizzgpt, i got a place in san diego with friends.</p>
    <p>i launched umax in december.  i joined hf0 in january and umax hit 500k mrr shortly thereafter</p>
    <p>now, i’m splitting time between sf and sd.</p>
    <p>i’ve got some big things i wanna build going forward...</p>
    <p>to be continued</p>
