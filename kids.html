        <p>things i will tell my kids</p>
        <p>1.</p>
        <p>Throughout your childhood, I will teach you everything that I have learned throughout my life because it has served me well.  
            There will be many lessons that applied to me that do not apply to you.  
            You can learn a lot from other peoplesâ€™ experiences, 
            but always take it with a grain of salt until you know it to be true through your own experiences</p>
