        <p>Lessons for my kids (and me).</p>
        <p>1.</p>
        <p>
            Throughout your childhood, I will teach you everything that has served me well.  
            Many lessons that applied to me will not apply to you.  
            You can learn a lot from others, 
            but always take it with a grain of salt until you know it to be true through your own experiences.

        <p>
            Brave enough to put it all on the line, intelligent enough to know when not to.

        <p>5.</p>
        <p>
            Speak the truth, no matter how it is received.  Act altruistically and happen as it should.
        </p>
        <p>6.</p>
        <p>
            Do not be anxious, for nobody thinks about you as much as yourself and everybody dies in the end.
